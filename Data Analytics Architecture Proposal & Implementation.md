# Data Analytics Architecture Proposal & Implementation 

## 1. Overall Design Principles

- **Modular Metrics**: Each product module features dedicated KPIs and user scenarios, supporting both real-time monitoring and future expansion.
- **Traceable Data Flow**: From source (API/third-party platform) to storage (Data Lake/Data Warehouse), through query to visualization, ensuring traceability and governance.
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Leverage AWS cloud services for scalability, flexibility, and security.
- **Low Coupling, High Scalability**: Data models and metrics are designed with extensibility in mind, making it easy to add new modules or dimensions.
- **Data Governance & Access Control**: Role-based access and audit trails to ensure privacy and compliance.
